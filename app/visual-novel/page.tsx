              Middleton's favorite superhero is no stranger to fighting crime. He's been protecting his town for years against a variety of villains, both the enhanced kind and the normies.
              <br />
              <br />
              But when his beautiful nemesis robs the wrong jewelry store, everything changes. There's a killer on the loose, and this small-town superhero has to team up with a bunch of sexy alliesâ€¦the photographer with a secret, the MILF-y detective with a chip on her shoulder, and an old high school crush who now sees him in a new light.
              <br />
              <br /> But his most powerful partner just might be the beautiful but ruthless burglar he's been pursuing for years.
